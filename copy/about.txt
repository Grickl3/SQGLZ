SQGLZ works with [(A)small firms] which provide [(B1)direct] [(B2)value] to [(C)society]. {(A) We consider a firm to be small if all of the members have some familiarity with each other. This includes volunteers, employees, managers, executives, and board members. In total, this could be as many as a hundred-fifty people, but is usually thirty-five or fewer.}{(B) Value is direct, from the SQGLZ perspective, if the providing firm engages with the recipient of the value they produce. This includes most for profit businesses and many non-profits. SQGLZ draws this line because it helps us to maintain a focused strategic tool set. Lobbyists, think tanks, advocacy groups, and any organization providing indirect value simply has a different set of design problems than the ones SQGLZ wants to tackle, at least for anyone but itself.} {(B2) A firm is providing value if it solves a problem, contributes to a discourse, or providing people with the tools they need to provide value, bonus points if you can make it recursive.} SQGLZ provides these firms with [(D)diagnostic services], digging deep into fears about new ventures and pain points in existing systems. {(D) Our diagnostics services are specific to design questions. If you're a carpenter, we won't help you improve your carpentry. There are other consultants for that. Our diagnostics are more about where you're wasting motion in your quoting process, getting you more referrals from your extant customers, and distinguishing you from your competitors so that you can earn more money in less time. Whatever you do for your clients and customers, we'll learn enough about that to sell it; the rest is up to you.} 

We open and expand targeted [(E)channels of communication]. {(E) SQGLZ assembles exactly the team you need to meet your goals. In this way we don't have any reason to shoehorn your project into our favorite type of work. We don't assume that you need to build your social media following or populate a massive mailing list. We sit with you, look at your goals, your audience, your current strengths, and any criterion related to those things. Then, and only then, do we begin the work of determining the specialists to achieve your desired results.} We develop [(F)engagement] building [(G)content]. {(F) } {(G) } And, we increase [(H)brand consistency]. 

We hone [(I)incentive systems], polish [(J)functionality], and seek [(K)elegance] in designs and operations. We [(L)automate] tasks when [(M)appropriate]. We do our work in [(N)collaboration] with our clients, [(O)not for them], and [(P)not apart from them].

SQGLZ seeks to understand worthy problems, to craft masterful processes, and to design elegant tools for bringing visions to life.

SQGLZ solves problems for the little guy.

	Shifting - recently - to focus on web development over print design or production, sqglz hopes to provide increased value to its clients through specialized service which is informed by widely varied experience.

	While focusing on web development, SQGLZ maintains its position that design is and must be about solving problems. Our goal when approaching a clients project is not to build them a pretty website, but to solve the problems that the business experiences.


		These days, sqglz is mostly involved in front-end web development. It's good to have focus. And, though this may seem like a far cry from SQGLZ early days of screen-printing posters and designing show fliers, the focus and process of sqglz is still much the same. When a client comes to us with a request we always consider the situation. Many times, clients know exactly what they need and we either get it done or connect them with exactly the firm that can. 

	A short list of the problems that clients have come to sqglz to solve:
		
		- Create a ticketing system for a festival which allows each performer to choose between a set of discounts and sliding scale options.
		- Create a quoting plug-in for a website which gives customers accurate pricing for window washing, accounting for number of windows height of windows, and all other relevant factors.
		- Create a public service announcement which will effectively persuade teenagers not to park in space reserved for people with disabilities. 
		- Determine and produce the greatest amount of high quality merchandise for a band tour on a very limited budget.
		- Create an algorithm that solves for constantly shifting scheduling conflicts and an interface for informing that algorithm quickly and accurately. 
		- Create anti-counterfeit features for a paper currency, which also needs to be a hundred times as physically resilient as the American Dollar. 
		- Build software to sort ad placements according to conflicts of interest between hundreds of advertisers and advertising venues on a recurring basis.

Deacon Rodda
In 2004 a friend who was moving across the country dropped a hobby level screen printing press in my lap and said, "You went to art school; you can do this." I started printing shirts (badly) for a couple of friend's bands and a few small businesses. Eventually, with a lot of help, I figured out what I was doing, and started branching out. After a few adventurous collaborations I founded SQGLZ in 2010. For years band shirts, handbills, posters, and album production were the mainstay. With some proding from clients and partners I decided to try my hands at making things pretty with 1s and 0s. Now, I mostly write code and relish the jobs that allow me to do a little lettering or illustration. 

Informing my contribution to the company are years of studying painting, economics, game design, lettering and now MEAN Stack front end development. I believe that design can &#8212; and should &#8212; be used to enliven the world, rather than merely ease the passing of days. My hope is that this conviction is expressed through SQGLZ in-house projects as well as our service to client's needs.
