SQGLZ solves problems for the little guy.

	Shifting - recently - to focus on web development over print design or production, sqglz hopes to provide increased value to its clients through specialized service which is informed by widely varied experience.

	While sqglz is now working primarily in the single medium of the web, it maintains its position that design is and must be about solving problems. Our goal when approaching a clients project is not to build them a pretty website, but to solve the problems that the business experiences.


		These days, sqglz is mostly involved in front-end web development. It's good to have focus. And, though this may seem like a far cry from SQGLZ early days of screen-printing posters and designing show fliers, the focus and process of sqglz is still much the same. When a client comes to us with a request we always consider the situation. Many times, clients know exactly what they need and we either get it done or connect them with exactly the firm that can. 

	A short list of the problems that clients have come to sqglz to solve:
		- Sort ad plaements according to conflicts of interest between hundreds of advertisers and advertsing venues on a recurring basis.
		- Create a ticketing system for a festival which allows each performer to choose between a set of discounts and sliding scale options.
		- Create a quoting plugin for a webstie which gives customers accurate pricing for window washing, accounting for number of windows height of windows, and all other relevant factors.
		- Create a public service announcement which will effectively persuade teenagers not to park in space reserved for people with disabilities. 
		- Determine and produce the greatest amount of high quality merchandise for a band tour on a very limited budget.
		- Create an algorith that solves for constantly shifting scheduling conflicts and an interface for informing that algorithm quicly and accurately. 
		- Create anti-counterfit features for a paper currency, which also needs to be a hundred times as physically resilient as the American Dollar.
