		All work is carried out by SQGLZ with the understanding that the client has agreed to SQGLZâ€™s terms and conditions.

		These terms, which are amended from time to time (Amendments are recorded on GitHub, such that the exact time when changes are made may be referenced in the event that it becomes needed), constitute the terms and conditions referred to within SQGLZ communications, contracts, quotes, and invoices. 


The Style Guide

	A style guide is a document which defines the patterns by which an organization presents itself. It clearly states what is essential to the organization's best representation of itself and - just as importantly - notes the expressions which would be antithetical to the organization's best representation.

	SQGLZ mostly works with small businesses and individuals many of whom operate without a style guide. The smaller your business, the less of a style guide you need. A single owner operator's personality is the personality of their business. And, this is as it should be. 

	So, from the SQGLZ perspective, a very small business is best branded by a few very simple core essentials: name, logo, colors, fonts, and unique value proposition. A larger business may be best served by spelling out everything from the acceptable use of colloquialisms to paper textures so that its many associates aren't left guessing about how they are expected to relate to clients, customers, and vendors.

	To get moving on any design project, an organization must have an established brand documented in a style guide appropriate to their scale of business. If a business has never established its brand parameters then this will be the first order of business with SQGLZ.

The Project Brief

	Before jumping into any project it must be defined. A client may draft a project brief or hire SQGLZ for a consultation, following which SQGLZ will create a proposal outlining its plan for solving the problems facing the client. 

	If you are interested in drafting your own brief but don't know where to start, SQGLZ recommends the following articles as good starting points:
		- https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/how-to-create-an-effective-creative-brief/
		- https://teamgantt.com/blog/use-example-build-great-project-brief/

	In the later case, SQGLZ prefers to discus the problem with the client briefly, research the problem independently, meet with the client to discus the problem, and then draft a project proposal. In some cases this will be the end of SQGLZ involvement as SQGLZ may find ideal solutions to the clients needs which do not include SQGLZ services.

	Whether working from a client provided brief or a SQGLZ produced proposal what should be documented includes:

		- A comprehensive description of the problems to be solved
		- A description of any failed attempts to solve this design problem and any details about why they may have failed
		- The scope of all work to be completed
		- The time-frame in which SQGLZ will complete the work
		- The points in the production process at which SQGLZ will expect payment
		- Ownership rights and privileges with regard to all project assets

	A SQGLZ provided proposal, or SQGLZ agreement to a client provided brief, constitute a quote from SQGLZ. This quote will stand for sixty days, following which SQGLZ cannot guarantee that its time will be available and at the same price. 

Revisions

	CONTENT REVISIONS
	Changing text, swapping graphical assets, and any similar alterations of content are usually incidental, and should not incur any additional billing. In some cases, such as when a photo has had to be retouched - and the new replacing photo will have to have the same work repeated, or when a text header has been treated with a cut-away effect, or a section of body text gets substantially longer, it may be the case that a non-negligible degree of work will be incurred. For these types of content revisions additional billing will have to be assessed. 

	DESIGN REVISIONS

	SCOPE CREEP
	SQGLZ does not work by the hour. For the client this means that all concerns about scope-creep, the tendency of projects to grow in complexity and time, are ours. This also means that SQGLZ pays keen attention to the deliverables defined in the project documentation. Requests outside of the project specs will be billed as additions to the project. 

Payment

	SQGLZ does not require payment to review a client style guide and project brief, but does require a flat rate of $200 for initial consultation (as described above) on a project which does not yet have a brief written.

	SQGLZ works to complete projects within written specifications. Each leg of a project begins with a payment as per its documentation. Projects do not generally proceed to their subsequent phases without previous payments being received. Generally, this functions well in lieu of a contract, though either party may request the creation of a contract for a project.

	Projects of a dollar value of five figures are done under contract.

	Contracted work may incur additional billing for efforts beyond their initial quote for the following reasons:
		- Communications with individuals other than our client contact person.
		- Revisions due to inadequate specification. 
		- Changes in project direction.
		- Changes in project scope.

Completion

	SQGLZ stands by its work. If, upon completion, some aspect of the project is found to have not met the project specifications then SQGLZ would like to made aware of this first. Design problems are dynamic and guarantees regarding design are correspondingly nebulous, but what SQGLZ can guarantee is that it will not ignore any requests to remedy a design problem which it has left merely partially solved.
