			<h3 class="main-content__title">The Mission of SQGLZ</h3>
			<p class="main-content__body-text">SQGLZ works with <span id="A-trigger" class="about__opener">small firms</span> which provide <span id="B1-trigger" class="about__opener">direct</span><span id="B2-trigger" class="about__opener"> value</span> to <span id="C-trigger" class="about__opener">individuals and society</span>.<span id="A-content" class="about__hidden"> We consider a firm to be small if all of the members have some familiarity with each other. This includes volunteers, employees, managers, executives, and board members. In total, this could be as many as a hundred-fifty people, but is usually thirty-five or fewer.</span><span id="B2-content" class="about__hidden"> A firm is providing value if it solves a problem, contributes to a discourse, or provides people with the tools they need to create value. <em>(We're fans of recursion.)</em></span><span id="B1-content" class="about__hidden"> Value is direct, from the SQGLZ perspective, if the providing firm generally engages with each recipient of the primary good or service of value which the firm produces. This includes most for profit businesses and many non-profits. SQGLZ draws this line because it helps us to maintain a focused strategic tool set. Lobbyists, think tanks, advocacy groups, and any organization providing indirect value simply has a different set of design problems than the ones SQGLZ has developed most of its experience working on. We produce more potent value for our clients through limiting the kinds of clients we take on, thereby understanding their problems all the better.</span><span id="C-content" class="about__hidden">In limiting ourselves to working with firms that provide a net value to society, we are taking a somewhat political and definitely ethical stand. There are a lot of businesses and non-profits built with a foundation that includes a scarcity mindset, or worse, that create artificial scarcity and shore up their slice of the pie instead of growing it. We work with tradesmen who lay bricks and hang drywall. We work with NGOs that build gardens and redirect food waste. SQGLZ will not work with companies that take interest without substantially sharing risk. SQGLZ doesn't work with game developers that use Skinner boxes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c" target="_more">1</a>, <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-skinner-box-2795875" target="_more">2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber" target="_more">3</a>) or are overtly built to survive on whales (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/63lvak/what_is_a_whale/" target="_more">4</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/" target="_more">5</a>). If you aren't in the gaming industry you can ignore those wonky terms. We believe that it is natural for people to derive their income through acting in service in such a way that makes the world a little friendlier, and not for one person at the expense of others.</span></p> 

			<p>SQGLZ provides its clients with <span id="D-trigger" class="about__opener">diagnostic services</span>, digging deep into fears about new ventures and pain points in existing systems.<span id="D-content" class="about__hidden"> Our diagnostics services are specific to design questions. If you're a carpenter, we don't claim that we will help you improve your carpentry. There are other consultants for that, trade unions and things. Our diagnostics are more about finding wasted motion in your quoting process, getting you more referrals from your extant customers, and publicly distinguishing you from your competitors so that you can earn more money in less time. We learn enough about what you do for your customers that we can competently sell it. Then we build or repair the systems to bolster those sales and protect you from lost opportunity.</span></p> 

			<p>We open and expand targeted <span id="E-trigger" class="about__opener">channels of communication</span>.<span id="E-content" class="about__hidden"> SQGLZ assembles exactly the team you need to meet your goals. In this way we don't have any reason to shoehorn your project into our favorite type of work. We don't assume that you need to build your social media following or populate a massive mailing list. We sit with you, look at your goals, your audience, your current strengths, and any criterion related to those things. We work with you to figure out what a real win would look like and how we can measure progress along the way. Then, and only then, do we begin the work of determining which specialists are suited to achieve your desired results.</span></p>

			<p>We develop <span id="F-trigger" class="about__opener">engagement</span> building <span id="G-trigger" class="about__opener">content</span>.<span id="F-content" class="about__hidden"> Engagement begins with interest, as opposed to compulsion. We look into your audience's actual interests and initiate dialog which opens up paths to community, discovery, achievement, and excitement through honest interaction with your brand. As an aside, if you don't know which of those experiences your product or service offering relates to most <a href="sms:1-303-501-7244">shoot Deacon a text</a> right now, seriously.</span></p>
			<p id="F2-content" class="quote about__hidden"><em>Note: Some design firms offer the ultimate engagement strategy through "gamification" with a one-size-fits-all, plug and play, formula. This really means that they know how to trigger dopamine and cortisol release in humans in general. Those aren't designers; they're muggers with cleverly designed weaponry. <a href="./a/gamification-ethics.html">full article</em></a></span></p>

			<p id="G-content" class="about__hidden"> Content includes every element which tells your clients and prospects anything about you. This includes business cards and stationary, blog and social media posts, vehicle wraps and dress codes, copy writing and photography, and your company policy about dogs in the shop. In the proto-sqglz days, circa 2006, when I was screen printing coffee shop and band T-shirts in the basement, I noticed that small businesses and punk bands had very different interests in the outcome of their shirts. SQGLZ expanded into other offerings and watched how each piece of merchandise and marketing collateral reflected the identity of the firm, or failed to, <em>'cause that also happens</em>. In 2012, when SQGLZ was asked to develop a large icon set for a very heady piece of software, it was because that piece of software was highly technical and had the potential to feel a bit draining. The icon sets on the market, besides not being comprehensive enough for the task, were very stark even when meant to be jovial. By creating an icon set with varied stroke widths and even some implied word-play, SQGLZ produced a very subtle indication that this piece of software was meant for use by humans with novel and fun goals.</p>

			<p>We increase <span id="H-trigger" class="about__opener">brand consistency</span>. <span id="H-content" class="about__hidden">SQGLZ has developed brand identity and helped to refine brand strategy for a whole lot of small business. By industry standards, we brand with a very light touch, though, because we believe that's what working with small businesses requires. We don't bill ourselves as a branding agency because it isn't the best way we can serve our clients or ourselves. <a href="./a/not-a-branding-agency.html"><em>full article</em></a></span></p>

			

			<p>We hone <span id="I-trigger" class="about__opener">incentive systems</span>.<span id="I-content" class="about__hidden"> An area of design that most creatives, coming from visually dominated training steer clear of is game-theoretics. But, game theory will make or break your business. One example, a cafe owner wants to increase sales inside of the cafe. A lot of people come in and get one drink, maybe two. All of the employees have been asked, at times, to make the rounds and simply ask patrons if they'd be interested in another drink. They aren't doing it, not very often at least. Are they poor employees? Observe a shift, actually, have someone else do it. Are the employees pretty steadily moving, getting things done? In many of these cases the staff encounter much more common cues from management and each other to get everything done quickly, to close fast, and to do a good enough job. What's more, there are hard incentives to get out faster. The shop closes, no more tips, which could be half of total pay. So, their financial incentive just dropped to half the normal hourly rate; that's a big reason to be finished shortly after closing time. If they sell more drinks, won't they get more tips? Some, certainly, and observation will show that when the employees are asking about refills it's with regulars and people they expect to tip well. So, they aren't bad employees; they're instinctively intelligent actors within a system. The simplest solution, share the wealth. Offering a little bit of profit sharing goes a long way. The employees know that they're getting paid for everything they sell, not just for their presence. Get ahead of the likely case that some employees will hear profit sharing and think they're getting a cut of gross revenue by setting a goal and rewarding employees for exceeding it. Make the goal just a hundred dollars higher than your average sales â€” twenty more beers a day split between several employees, easy. This is a brass tacks design solution in which you only spend a portion of the money you wouldn't get without committing to spend it. That's good design.</span></p>

			<p>We polish <span id="J-trigger" class="about__opener">functionality</span>.<span id="J-content" class="about__hidden"> Some of the most common design solutions we find in business don't have anything to do with branding or aesthetics. These problems are architectural, ergonomic, or sociological in nature. In example: Do you get most of your business through referrals? Print the highest quality business cards you can find before spending much money on your website. The former helps people to feel good about referring you and the later just needs to match and allow people to get a hold of you. Do you want your cafe to be a highly social space with tables that turnover instead of a de facto co-working space where people sit for hours? Remove outlets along the lobby walls and turn off the wifi; the cost of some drywall patches will pay for itself with table turnover in a week. Conversely, you could install more outlets, the nice ones with built in USB chargers, if your goal is to communicate that yours is a place for getting work done. Just make sure that your menu is full of small portions of finger food, and that you have a little retail section with flash drives and business books. Do you work in the trades and spend a ton of time answering the same questions on the phone? Refine your FAQ and integrate it into you website homepage and answering service. That's a one time set-up cost, as opposed to hiring a reception service you may not be ready for. Do you manage a food or beverage service business with high employee turnover and can't afford a higher base pay? Develop performance incentives that pay for themselves in objectively measurable ways â€” <em>and those incentives don't all have to be monetary</em>. Sound tricky, doesn't have to be. That's what we're for.</span></p>

			<p>We seek <span id="K-trigger" class="about__opener">elegance</span> in designs and operations.<span id="K-content" class="about__hidden"> By elegance, we mean simplicity without sacrifice.</span></p>

			<p>We do our work in <span id="N-trigger" class="about__opener">collaboration</span> with our clients, <span id="O-trigger" class="about__opener">not for them</span>, and <span id="P-trigger" class="about__opener">not apart from them</span>.</p>

			<p><span id="N-content" class="about__hidden">Sometimes, especially when design is treated as pretty-making, we designers can be guilty of getting too much distance from clients in order to work, only to find out that our work doesn't solve the clients problem. Then there's tension. Our approach involves a few long meetings. In the end, though, the results are so much better.</span><span id="O-content" class="about__hidden">Being committed to problem solving means that we can't just take orders. Imagine visiting a doctor and ordering up a session of chemo because you feel cancer-y. Their professionalism, not to mention regulatory agencies, forbid that kind of thing. Now, imagine walking into a design house and just ordering up a vehicle wrap. If the designer obliges without inquiring about the businesses underlying goals they're doing the same kind of disservice to that business as a doctor would to a patient by not conducting the standard tests.</span><span id="P-content" class="about__hidden"> Designers are just as guilty as clients, if not more so, of jumping to diagnostic conclusions. I've done it. I'll admit it. But, gone are the days when every client who walks through the door leaves with an informational site, three T-shirt designs, and business cards. SQGLZ won't do any work for you that we don't collaboratively determine that you need to meet your goals.</span></p>

			<p class="main-content__body-text">SQGLZ diagnoses <span id="Q-trigger" class="about__opener">problems</span>.</p>
			<p id="Q-content" class="about__hidden">As a business operator, you know the craft you provide. What we do is let you focus on that while we look closely at how that offering is, and could be, presented to the world. We refine that presentation in pictures and sounds, in stories and expressions, and in carefully selected mediums and platforms. We find the best clients and customers for you and tell them everything that you can do for them.</p>

			<p class="main-content__body-text">SQGLZ develops <span id="R-trigger" class="about__opener">strategies</span>.</p>
			<p id="R-content" class="about__hidden">Our approach is shrewdly strategic. We start with your goal. What do you want to achieve through partnership with a design firm? We dissect that goal, its implications, the stakeholders affects, the resources available. We look at multiple options, always considering SQGLZ may not be the best solution. We methodically study the possibilities and we plan an approach from start to finish.</p>

			<p class="main-content__body-text">SQGLZ <span id="S-trigger" class="about__opener">designs</span> solutions.</p>
			<p id="S-content" class="about__hidden">Our clients are business owners and non-profit directors, people who don't have time to waste, who want hard answers, who like to poke things and look under the hood. In designing this page we included a 'collapse all button' but not a 'show all' button. Seeing just how long this piece of writing is could be a good reason to leave the page. Opening any given clarification element just tells you what you want to know. That's design. Isn't design about pretty pictures? Less so, but yeah,<span id="img-trigger" class="about__opener"> we do that</span> too.</p>
