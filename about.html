				<p class="main-content__body-text">Shifting - recently - to focus on web development over print design and production, sqglz hopes to provide increased value to its clients through specialized service which is informed by widely varied experience.</p>
				<p>While focusing on web development, SQGLZ maintains its position that design is and must be about solving problems. Our goal when approaching a client's project is not to build them a pretty website, but to solve the problems that the business experiences.</p>

			<div id="deacon-box" class="pull-down__box hidden">
				<p class="main-content__body-text">In 2004 a friend who was moving across the country dropped a hobby level screen printing press in my lap and said, "You went to art school; you can do this." I started printing shirts <em>(badly)</em> for a couple of friend's bands and a few small businesses. Eventually, with a lot of help, I figured out what I was doing, and started branching out. After a few adventurous collaborations I founded SQGLZ in 2010. For years band shirts, handbills, posters, and album production were the mainstay. With some proding from clients and partners I decided to try my hand at making things pretty with ones and zeros. Now, I mostly write code and relish the jobs that allow me to do a little lettering or illustration.</p>
				<p>Informing my contribution to the company are years of studying painting, economics, game design, lettering and now MEAN Stack front end development. I believe that design can &#8212; and should &#8212; be used to enliven the world, rather than merely ease the passing of days. My hope is that this conviction is expressed through SQGLZ in-house projects as well as our service to client's needs.</p>

				<p class="main-content__body-text">Below, you will find a list of quality tools for getting creative and entrepreneurial tasks done. These are tools I've returned to again and again, even the ones made by us.</p>
				<ul class="main-content__list-main">
					<li class="main-content__list-item-main"><a href="https://verbingnounssincewhen.com/">Verbing Nouns Since When</a> is a SQGLZ project for people who need filler text, especially for the web. Programming by <a href="http://scarpetti.com/" target="_blank">David Scarpetti</a>. English syntax templates by yours truly, Deacon Rodda.</li>  
					<li class="main-content__list-item-main">The <a href="http://scarpetti.com/accordiomatic/" target="_resource">Accordiomatic</a> is actually a tool that David made for me when I was designing CSPT-79, before he came on-board the good ship SQGLZ. It creates excellent toggling divs. If you're one of many entrepreneurial types who write enough markup to Wordpress your way through representing yourself, but don't write any Javascript, then you may end up loving this tool.</li>
					<li class="main-content__list-item-main"><a href="http://paletton.com/" target="_resource">Palleton</a> is a fantastic color scheme tool. If you are branding yourself or just painting your bedroom this tool is most excellent.</li>
					<li class="main-content__list-item-main"><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/" target="_resource">Butterick's Practical Typography</a>, read it. If your life requires writing and other people are required to read what you write then you <em>as well as your victims</em> will be greatly served by your having done so <em>&#8212; that is, after you've read the eternally requisite <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b572/public/StrunkWhite.pdf" target="_resource">Strunk and White.</a></li>
