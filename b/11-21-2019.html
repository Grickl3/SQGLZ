			<p><em>now, in no particular order:</em></p>

			<h3>Integrate, Don't Segregate</h3>

			<p>I was just in a conversation with my son's mother in which the common assertion about the importance of public school for socialization was brought up. We each had criticisms of this notion. Among them was a question of this apparent presumption that kids benefit from time around children their own age, and — in the case of schools — children pretty much <em>exactly</em> their own age.</p>

			<p>Investigating learning, one can find a lot of support for the idea that a person learns most in two settings: in the presence of those with palpably greater experience and when required to teach something to someone from tabula rasa. In the presence of undeniable mastery the cup empties itself and the mind becomes pliable. When one has to find new ways of explaining something, one has to make new connections to that information.</p>

			<h3>Produce No Waste</h3>
	
			<p>One of the most compelling arguments I've heard from the passionate if not commendable organization <a href="https://denverhomelessoutloud.org/" target="_blank">Denver Homeless Out Loud</a> is that our current economic structure produces human waste. While the argument they are asserting is not different in content or evidence from arguments which come to less horrid phrasing, this way of putting the problem may be the most apt. When one looks at the bi-products of interest-baring-debt based monetary issuance, the mechanics which facilitate prison recidivism, the social welfare cliff dilemma, education disparity and expense, unmanaged economic retraction, legal allowances for corporate externalities, disproportionate regulation of small businesses, the barrier to entry created by a SAAS focused software industry … holy hell, I barely paused cranking out that list. The entire economic system in which we live is designed to exacerbate income disparity. Nature demands certain symmetries and those who want to push their already escape velocity wealth to new frontiers are entirely willing that others should suffer the consequences on the other side of the mirror.</p>
