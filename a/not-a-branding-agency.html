			<p> Your brand is what people feel when they interact with, or even recall, your firm. Its what people think about you. SQGLZ works with small businesses. Sometimes they're well established; sometimes they're just getting moving. But, because they're small there's usually a distinct personality already in place. SQGLZ often helps businesses to clarify this personality in terms that can be reflected in details like color and type. Or, simply eliminate anything that doesn't fit. We brand with a very light touch.</p>

			<h2>SQGLZ isn't — specifically — <br>a branding firm.</h2>

			<p>This is for two counterintuitively coupled reasons: One, offering branding as a primary service is the hippest thing to do right now. Deacon spent a bunch of time as a barista and used to operate a legit speakeasy <em>(like, if you walked through the door at the back of the old print shop there was a room that was bigger than the press room with a bar and a stage — pretty sure the statute of limitations is up on that one *fingers crossed*)</em>. Whatever cool points there were to be mopped up, we got 'em. And, to be honest, we still aren't that cool. We watch the times and dress for the weather but we tend to buck the trends.</p>

			<p>Two, there are some firms that are really good at branding (<a href="https://blind.com/" target="_more">Blind</a>, <a href="https://landor.com/" target="_more">Landor</a>, <a href="https://www.brandjuice.com/" target="_more">Brandjuice</a>, etc.). They are trend setters; they're super good, and they're really expensive. The trend followers beneath that tip-top, though, well … whenever there's a shift in industry trends, things get competitive in that trendy space.</p>

			<p>So, right now, if you want a super posh brand you're in business at the best time in history because the steep competition in that super cool space means that the people in the middle are still pretty good and they're competing on price. Be careful, though, a hammer sees only nails. Before you approach a branding agency, be sure that a re-brand is the best option to meet your goals. Asking a branding agency if a re-brand will help your business is like asking a jeweler if your girlfriend wants diamonds.</p> 

			<p>Tying that all together, yeah, we could brand or re-brand you. That's a thing we've done. We'll do it again. As our primary service offering, though, we prefer to stay at the deep end of the pool where trend followers won't ever be able to swim — real problem solving. Real, no assumptions, Socratic method, everyone gets called on their sh!t, nothing is sacred, problem solving.</p>
