			<h1>Never Sell<br>Never Retire</h1>
			<h5>— Blair Enns</h5>

			<p>Somewhere in my mid-teens, I spent a summer working for my family's glass block company. I served as an extra pair of hands whenever those hands didn't need to know what they were doing. I spent a lot of time watching and trying to stay out of the way. A job came up that I could tell was a big deal from the flow of the conversation that my grandfather had with the client. In many respects it was simple, a residential walk-in shower, home under construction, very specific expectations. The complications: the specification was for two curved, freestanding walls on a slightly banked surface. Glass block isn't laid like brick. The panels are assembled and installed as one piece. For a curved wall, single block wide columns are poured which are then set in to place against each other. Suffice it to say, there was no shortage of either tedium or risk.</p>

			<p>The panels were poured and cured. Early in the morning my grandfather oversaw their transport to the job site. Then we went to make a stop we'd never made before. We picked up an older man, older than my grandfather by at least twenty years. He was a crass man and spry.</p>

			<p>On this job the only thing I was qualified to do was carry buckets of water and grab drinks from the cooler. But I watched. All day long, to my ignorant eyes, I saw this old man messing with the young men. He made the crudest jokes, often at their expense. I'm sure I learned half a dozen insults and slurs for human anatomy. He added trivial bits of water to mortar. He poked at shims and wiped his finger along grout lines. His presence and his attitude seemed so flippant and interruptive that I wondered if my grandfather had just brought him to see which of the young guys would crack under the hazing.</p>

			<p>At the conclusion of the day, the walls stood at true plumb from their slopped foundation, elegantly curving inward at each other. I climbed into the back of my grandfather's utility van and the older man climbed in shotgun. As we pulled up to the older man's house my grandfather handed him a wad of cash like I'd only seen in movies and thanked him. He pocketed the money easily, said something cheerful, and was gone.</p>

			<p>I scrambled up front, my confusion evident. My grandfather told me that he had something to show me. We drove down near the university and my grandfather thrust a large and certain finger toward an ageless artifact of architecture. It's obvious, I'm sure, that I'm about to indicate that the elder in question had a hand in the building in question. What my grandfather explained to me was that he wouldn't have taken the job without knowing that he'd have had the master available.</p>

			<p>Early experiences of work have settled within me like so many cobblestones anchoring the floor of old Manhattan. Moments like this one come to mind in so many circumstances, with varied implications. There is a thing in the reverence my grandfather held for that master builder that I, personally, want. That's not a moral-of-the-story take away;</p>

			<p>… let's call it gravity.</p>

			<hr>


			<p>A copy of <em>Snowball</em>, Alice Schroeder's biography of Warren Buffet, is sitting on my shelf. I'm ashamed to say that I've only picked through it. <em>The time will come</em>. I picked it up because of a conversation that I had with my former business partner about some of Buffet's business practices. Apparently Buffet and Munger used to spend a lot of time looking for businesses that showed promise but weren't necessarily high performing, or weren't yet. Later, they began simply buying companies which were performing well on the contingency that key executives agree to never retire. Whether the former practice was because of necessity or inexperience, Charlie Munger attributes to the change a good deal of their success. It allowed them to pick winners and keep them winning long enough for patient legacy planning to take place.</p>

			<p>Last anecdote before we tie this all together: I know a man, Lary Leeper, who is a certified master in a number of fields. He's a sixth dan in Kaju Ryu Karate and former ensei practitioner, a chess master with a rating around 2400, a world champion gem cutter, a third dan go master, a decorated tenis player, and a rather accomplished carpenter. He has basically no financial or remaining public success to speak of. Why? Well, he gets bored and looks for something that might challenge him. I once saw him spend a month trying to work out the exact engineering methods used to build the great pyramid because he figured there was probably something the experts had all missed. He came up with a theory he was satisfied with and moved on.</p>

			<p>Despite the fact that Lary has never stuck with an occupation or intellectual pursuit long enough to reap what society considers commiserate rewards for mastery he is quite happy, one of the happiest people I've ever met. Why? Well, who can say for sure? I have my suspision, though, that it has something to do with the adventure that he's stuck with for about fifty years. He married the woman that his mother told him he should and they made it work.</p>

			<h3>Never sell; never retire.</h3>

			<p>Looking at the pursuits in which we do work to receive outward compensation, maybe even recognition, there are three mistakes that I believe I see as common. The zeroth mistake is that we forget the reality of death. This mistake is present in, <em>or is the root of</em>, the other three.</p>

			<h2>1) Planning to Stop</h2>
			<p>Few traits are common to both the CEO of a company being purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and the scrappy old timer that my grandfather trucks around to hard jobs. Some of those few traits may be the most import traits that any professional can aspire to. Chief among them is that their mastery is pervasive enough that it is uninhibited by age. With mastery comes an enormous reduction in exertion, even when one is doing the work themselves. </p>

			<h2>2) Planning to Change Direction</h2>

			<h2>3) Planning for Ourselves</h2>

			<p>Wrap it up.</p>
