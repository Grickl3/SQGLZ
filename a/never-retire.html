			<h1>Never Sell;<br>Never Retire</h1>
			<h5>— Blair Enns</h5>

			<p>Somewhere in my mid-teens, I spent a summer working for my family's glass block company.</p>

			<p>A copy of <em>Snowball</em>, Alice Schroeder's biography of Warren Buffet, is sitting on my shelf. I'm ashamed to say that I've only picked through it. <em>The time will come</em>. I picked it up because of a conversation that I had with my former business partner about some of Buffet's business practices. Apparently, Buffet and Munger used to spend a lot of time looking for businesses that showed promise but weren't necessarily high performing, or weren't yet. Later, they began simply buying companies which were performing well on the contingency that key executives agree to never retire. Whether the former pratice was because of necessity or inexperience, Charlie Munger attributes to the change a good deal of their success. It allowed them to pick winners and keep them winning long enough for patient legacy planning to take place.</p>

			<p>Last anecdote: I know a man, Lary Leeper, who is a certified master in a number of fields. He's a sixth dan in Kaju Ryu Karate and former ensei practitioner, a chess master with a rating around 2400, a world champion gem cutter, a third dan go master, a decorated tenis player, and a rather accomplished carpenter. He has basically no financial or remaining public success to speak of. Why? Well, he gets bored and looks for something that might challenge him. I once saw him spend a month trying to work out the exact engineering methods used to build the great pyramid because he figure there was probably something the experts had all missed. He came up with a theory he was satisfied with and moved on.</p>

			<p>Despite the fact that Lary has never stuck with an occupation or intellectual pursuit long enough to reap much reward he is quite happy; one of the happiest people I've ever met. Why? Well, who can say for sure. I have my suspision, though, that it has something to do with the adventure that he's stuck with for about fifty years. He married the woman that his mother told him he should and they made it work.</p>

			<h3>Never sell; never retire.</h3>

			<p>Planning to stop.</p>

			<p>Planning to change direction.</p>

			<p>Forgetting the next 100 yrs</p>

			<p>Wrap it up.</p>
