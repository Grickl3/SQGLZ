			<h1>Who has tended the land on which we gather?</h1>

			<p>It feels right to reach back into history to the time of convenient heroes. If we praise the natives in their prime, whose human faults are obscured by death and forgiven by guilt, we are less to blame for this colonialism. That feels right.</p>

			<p>Between the natives we idolize and ourselves there have been many to tend the land. They came for gold and silver, copper and lead. They came for adventure and furs. They came for cattle and farmland. They came to gamble money and to buy sex. Most have tended the land badly. Some have tended the land well.</p>

			<p>The land in which I was born was tended by a million ambitious midwestern Boomers, escaping the Rust Belt and investing in styrofoam. The land in which we played as children was tended by jack rabbits and tail shedding lizards and the last of Denver's fire flies and blue jays. The land in which I was educated was tended by scholarly artisans and uncompromising masters of form. The land in which I found my own way was tended by brash and stern Greek men, carboloading the drunks, the cops, and us hooligans with equal indifference. The streets where I cut my teeth were festooned by the elders of us they called vandals.</p>

			<p>This land has been tended by the amoral and the ignorant, and it has been cleansed in fire and flood.</p>

			<p>Where there is a wide open sky or an expanse of untamed woods, passions will stir in the pilgrim and the predator alike. The land will weather them all.</p>
