			<p>I’ve been given many gifts in my life. That doo-dad at the bottom of my necklace is older than calculus. It was a gift from an old scholar as a blessing on my path as a martial artist. When I opened Fortify, a friend and former student paid for the flooring. My teachers contributed equipment. The outpouring of support has been a consistent goad to keep moving, to stay on the path. I have a beautiful solid brass pen that a kind gentleman once handed to me and said, “I have a feeling that you would appreciate this.” I do. And, these physical gifts are only one side of it. I have received thousands of hours of individual attention from sagasic minds accomplished in martial arts, politics, chess and go, Kabbalism, and business. There’s an old man who used to play chess with Bobby Fishcer and Kasparov, yet he takes the time to play with me. I don’t know that anyone can deserve the kind of fortune that I’ve experienced, but I try to live up to it. I strive to merit the gifts I am given. And, God willing, I’ll live long enough to pay back one-tenth of one-thousandth — as the Shinto say. That is the best we can hope to do.</p>

			<p>By far, the most valuable things which I’ve ever been given are opportunities. I am surrounded by people eager to help me with all sorts of wild ideas, based merely on the shared understanding that, together, we have a shot at shaping a better world. Sometimes that faith comes in the form of hours and hours clicking out code. Sometimes it comes as two dollars a month. In all cases, I see it as faith. And, I really don’t want to let you all down.</p>

			<h1>You have my thanks and my camaraderie.</h1>

			<h3>Ryan C.</h3>
			<p>Starting the individual shoutouts with Ryan is a bit of a no-brainer to me. When I look around my physical surroundings, he’s simply given me so many actual gifts. The man is a prolific sculptor, so it may seem only natural. He lives and thrives in artifacts of practicality and expression. There is, though, a peculiar brilliance to Ryan’s gifts. He somehow manages to consistently find or craft gifts which are both an enhancement to the day-to-day life of the recipient and an expression of himself. It’s a neat trick. I really enjoy the ever present reminders of my distant friend.</p>

			<div class="space--small"></div>

			<h3>Betsy L.</h3>
			<p>An impressive and stunning trait which I’ve found in very few people is the capacity to give generously and creatively like clockwork. Betsy is possessed of this virtue. A birthday comes around; Betsy shows up. And, she doesn’t just have a gift. She has a one of a kind gift: an antique book on a subject of particular interest by a favorite author, or an imported tea only available in one shop at the far end of town. It is impossible to not feel the dedication and the value of caring, familial tradition.</p>

			<div class="space--small"></div>

			<h3>Marty H.</h3>
			<p>Objects which Marty gave me include a weighted jump rope, a copy of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and a Doors album on cassette. He also left me one of the most important examples that a person can model, how to die incredibly well. Having grown up in dojos, I’ve heard — and repeated — a lot of talk about the importance of daily contemplation of the end of one’s own life. The representation in that environment frequently implies that one should rehearse the end of one’s life in order to be at peace in battle. In a way, this is true. But, Marty demonstrated a higher interpretation. We keep the fact of our end in front of us in order to make the best possible decisions in all of the little battles. When we live in such a way that the effects which follow our influence in the world are an evergreen harvest, we can slip away in peace. We can know that we have left good will, reputation, and an example for those we leave behind.</p>
