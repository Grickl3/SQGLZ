		<h1>What Saddens Me Most …</h1>
	
		<div class="main-content__section">

			<h2>It isn't the police violence.</h2>
			<p>Thanks to time with Chogyam Trungpa, Byron Katie, and the Epistle of St. James, I have come to a place of clarity about where my suffering begins and ends (I'm not name dropping; I'm bread crumbing. Dig into that reading list and get free, for real.). The police and other individuals who abuse positions of power are not a part of my community. I have no tether to the moral value of their choices. The abuses of authority which hurt us so much can only invite us into their hell. Pain is inevitable. Death is inevitable. Suffering and hate are voluntary, and I don't.</p>

			<h2>It isn't the global pandemic.</h2>
			<p>Disease is the most intimate companion of our hubris. Disease is not malicious. Infections are consistent and honest. Even those who deny that there is a disease to contend with are only reacting honestly to all of the betrayals they've experienced from authorities and education. I'm not angry or particularly disappointed in those who either think the sky is falling because someone isn't in a mask or because others are. Every part of it is natural. There's no malice in it, not inherently.</p>

			<h2>It isn't even the forest fires.</h2>
			<p>And, I am a pretty serious dendrophile. But, the forests can hold their own. Burn every stick to ash. They'll pop back up when we're gone; it's just a blink to them.</p>

			<div class="space--small"></div>

			<p>What really makes me sorrowful, what makes me feel like giving up and walking away, is how I see people that I've respected and want so badly to continue to respect speaking about and behaving toward those who are different than them.</p>

			<p>Now more than ever, I see that my community is full of folks who accept sexism, accept racism, accept all sorts of hateful behavior and bigotry.</p>

			<p>Once Trump had the republican nomination, four years ago, fascists started crawling out into the open. They were always there, but all of a sudden they had permission to make some noise. First, I noticed the fascists on the right. Then, as if emboldened by all of the fun they thought the Breitbart/Proud Boy crowd was having, the bigots on the left started getting a little more vocal and repugnant as well. And, I was very disappointed that several of them lived behind faces I thought I knew.</p>

			<p>Everyday now, I see people that I thought had some sense making cruel sweeping generalizations about cis folks, or men, or white people, statements that — if made about any other group of people — would be the end of their social standing all together. There's nothing alright about it. It's hideous.</p>

			<p>I'm disgusted every time I see someone make a scathing blanket statement about Christians, about straight people, and YES even about republicans. They have ideas that are different than yours, sure, but do you even know if their values are different? You're talking about people, real humans with real reasons for their ideas and positions — let alone people who just have a normative sexuality or gender expression.</p>

			<p>If you think that a person having an idea that you don't agree with is justification to disparage their fundamental human dignity, their value, the legitimacy of their experience, or the sanctity of their life, than you've already taken the only difficult step toward putting that person in a gas chamber. Sound hyperbolic? Well, if you read your history closely it is the exact opposite. You see the reason the Third Reich used gas chambers is that this innovation allowed them to split up all of the responsibility for killing people into a hundred tiny jobs — enough so that they could actually get Jews to perform some of the grizzliest tasks to keep the machine running. They replaced the firing squad, and eliminated the dissonance.</p>

			<h2>The only big step toward totalitarian fascism is othering.</h2>
			<div class="space--small"></div>
			<h5>It's all easy baby steps from there.</h5>

			<p>And, I don't want to be vague here. If you think that a cis-white-hetero-man with a 401-K ought to be — in any way — forcibly silenced on general principle, you are a fucking nazi. If you think that J.K. Rowling ought to “suffer consequences” (actual statement made) for having the audacity to opin that ‘woman’ is a reasonable descriptor for people who menstruate, you are a fucking nazi.</p>

			<p>This is super simple. Don't attack people for what they think; discuss the ideas themselves. More critically, don't move ideological conflict from discourse into a space of social leverage or other forms of use of force — ever (because that is both the meaning of fascism as well as the entire reason that it is wrong).</p>

			<p>A person is not their circumstance or even their beliefs — which, at the end of the day, are also just circumstantial. A person is a human being. It doesn't matter if they don't believe in germs, think the earth is flat, and can't understand how a woman could be attracted to another woman. They are still an infinite and unfathomable universe of existence in their own right, and that is a thing which ought to be respected.</p>

			<p>Oh, and I know I'll be un-friend-ed for this. I know that I'll get canceled and found to be problematic by many little expedient judges and juries. And, honestly, it does hurt. It doesn't hurt because I care so much about what random people think. It hurts because a lot of the people I'm talking about are people I've really cared about quite a lot. They are people I never would have let an idea estrange me from, people I would never have condemned for anything short of reprehensible behavior, people I have been ready to lay it all down for. But, it has become clear to me that to them I am just an arithmetical expression. I get points for being black, and triple black points for having been assaulted by cops because that's trending right now. But, I lose a lot of points for being straight, being male, being a gun owner … shit, I think I'm losing the game. And, I'm pretty sure that's all I am to the serious leftists I know, just the sum of my identity points and however much I can leverage them through double speak.</p>

			<p>Well, I'm through. I'm calling bull shit. I'm done.</p>

			<p>And, looking at how some of those bigoted, fascist assholes talk about others these days, seeing that they recommend silencing people, limiting human voices, getting rid of the people they find undesirable, it just hurts. That's it. I've got no hell to put anyone in. I'm not going to pretend to cancel anyone because that's ignorant nonsense. I just have to be real. I have to be honest because by not saying anything I'm enjoying a dishonest privilege that I could choose to keep because I know how to talk PC and I can pass for progressive. But, that's not living, and I can't serve anyone that way. And, that's what I want. I want to be of service. And, the best service I can see at this very moment is to openly say that some people I have real love for have some terrible issues to deal with, and I can't ignore it any longer.</p>

			<p>I have to be honest in order to live in a place of peace with myself. And, honestly, It hurts to watch some of you talk.</p>

			<p>If you made it this far and you don't want me canceled, maybe there's a chance that you want to help me on my quest to create real solutions that empower communities of people who don't want to forcibly change others?</p>

			<p>Well, if so, then won't you consider supporting me to the tune of $2/mo. on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sqglz" target="_social">Patreon</a> as I refine methods of social change and personal empowerment, which I prototype and publish for feedback and general social uplift.</p>
