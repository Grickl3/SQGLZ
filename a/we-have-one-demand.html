			<p>Journal Entry<br>November 19, 2019</p>
			<h1>We have one simple demand,</h1>

			<p>everything.</p>

			<div class="space--medium"></div>

			<p>A close friend of mine picked up a position with the notorious anarchist writers collective Crime Think. It meant moving to Ashvile, <em>like a good anarchist</em>. I didn't see him for a while. He's on the no-fly list. Road trips only. When we next connected he gave me a collection of one inch pinback buttons he'd made while with the collective and told me that he had a book coming out soon. This is a long credit, but that's what it is. My favorite of the buttons stated the above expectation, plainly. He meant it.</p>

			<p>A month and a half from this writing I am slated to begin a role as a facilitator of the Denver Permaculture Guild's next Social Permaculture Design Course. I've been playing a minor role since the beginning of the permaculture design course program. Usually, I drop in and give a lecture on the obsolescence of Capitalism and the failings of Socialism. Reviews have been mixed.</p>

			<p>Participation in the project is an odd sort of legacy role for me. In 2005 I and a few chosen-family members founded a non-profit called the Sherwood Project. We worked super hard, got a great big land grant — lake front even. We did some cool work, established some warm relationships, and made a ton of very educational mistakes. In 2008 the real estate magnate who had bestowed us with our land grant called me and stated very flatly that the real estate world was expecting a few rough years and that he would be "consolidating his portfolio". We lost our land grant, but, if I'm being honest (which is my aim), it was a relief. We'd made so many mistakes the program was a house of cards, and with our charter stating that we were established to research sustainable models. Our notion of what that meant included permaculture design, bio-intensive agriculture, midwifery, green building, hunting and fishing, body work, and all manner of holistic medicine. <em>It took months of haggling with the IRS to get them to approve our gargantuan scope of operations</em>.</p>

			<p>We did manage to collect a good amount of data on bio-intensive gardening in Colorado's Front Range. To that end we succeeded at modeling sustainability. But, we were — as a group of humans — working on borrowed financial, social, and physical resources. There was nothing sustainable about our structure, our process, or our intended scope.</p>

			<p>After losing our land grant, one of the organization's volunteers told us that we needed to talk to this guy, Adam, who had really cool ideas about something similar. Within a month we'd handed off the entire project to Adam and Coby and washed our hands of it. It was quickly and wisely rebranded as the Grow Haus and the rest is history.</p>

			<p>This may be a story of audacity meeting face to face with the grim visage of resource constraints, paperwork, and routine. It may be more, but it's probably a loosely coupled rant.</p>

			<p>I still want it all. What's more, I don't want anything at all if doesn't benefit everyone. I didn't get these politics from holistic permies and transitionists. I got them from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokely_Carmichael" target="_bib">Stokley Charmichael</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7lngzFqRa5VFpAQxKAsrzr?si=zxrSbgxdQvyXkby2BC1dbg" target="_bib">Coolio</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4RALofCf1N7YlC2yPLIO5w?si=V45S2kOWTQS1S4a6I2BgiQ" target="_bib">Boots Riley</a> — in that chronological order. I had a weird childhood.</p>

			<p>Wanting it all, and actually going for it, has provided me with what has turned out to be a literally unbelievable lifetime of stories. Nearly every one of those stories is of failure. Some comic failures. Some tragic failures. Student loans could never cover the cost of my education.</p>

			<p>At some point I began to see that success came more from picking winnable fights than from being good at fighting.</p>
